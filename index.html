        <h2>What you need to know</h2>
        <p>making webpages isn't really complicated you might think you need to be super smart 
            but you don't. <br>Think of websites like houses,
             there are three main things that make them what they are, a structure, a nice external look,
 and electronics like ovens, wiring, and plumbing. <br>
For websites there structure is something called html, it's external look is something 
called css and, it's electronics is something called javascript. hi
